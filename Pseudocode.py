#pseudocode for final project
#Find the sampling distribution of Wolbachia from ants sampled in Russell, 2012 (Myrmecological News)


#ant_species = list of ant species surveyed in Russell 2012


#extract genus names from ant_species to identify genera that dominate sampling efforts that have been done and to highlight genera that need more attention
#count number of each genus present 
#return value for each genus 


#Identify each species' infection status and group uninfected and infected species together
#def infection_status(ant_species):
	#positive = any line with a "+"
	#negative = any line with a "-"


#Compare the percent of infected and uninfected species in each genus to determine if there are any patterns in infection
#for "genus" in ant_species:
	#return % where infection_status = positive for each genus
	#return % where infection_status = negative for each genus

#If data is available, look at life histories of infected vs. noninfected species 
#for "life_history" in ant_species:
	#if "+", return life history characteristics 
	#if "-", return life history characteristics 

#Look at geographic distribution of Wolbachia infections 
#for "collection_site" in ant_species:
	#return list of sites where Wolbachia was found in ants
	#return list of sites where Wolbachia was not found in sampled species

#Make relevant figures to visualize the results of each test
